<h1>"The Last Samurai" The movie that started it all</h1>
<h2><p>My passion for movies and cinematography has started after watching this film.
    <strong>The ability to showcase the story and emotions that are associated with it.</strong>
    This film has made me realise that the creativity needed to put these kind of stories showcased as movies
    might be something that i can learn to do and also ever since I've been passionate about cinematography
     <strong>We live to tell the story</strong> and that is what i want to do.</p>
